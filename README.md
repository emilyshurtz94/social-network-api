## Description
    I created an application for people to become friends and comment and react to their friends posts.  In this application one can create a new user/ update a user/ add a friend to a user/ or delete a user,friend, or thought. You can also add or update a thought. You can also react to friends thoughts by creating a reaction. If you don't like the reaction you created you can delete it.
